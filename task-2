A doubled sequence SN is a sequence that holds the following conditions:

- It contains each value in {1,2,…,N} exactly twice.
- Let Li and Ri be the leftmost and rightmost occurrence of i in SN, then Ri−Li=i.

Given N, find any doubled sequence SN or determine that none exists.

Standard input
- The first line of input contains an integer T, the number of test cases.
- The following t lines contain an integer N, the i-th line contains the N corresponding to the i-th query.

Standard output
Print T lines, the i-th line must contain a doubled sequence SN or −1 if there are no doubled sequences.

Constraints and notes
1 ≤ T ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ Ni ≤ 10^6 for each i=1,…,T
1 ≤ Sigma i=1 until t  Ni ≤ 10^6
